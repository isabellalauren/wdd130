      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I originally created an elevator pitch for a potential site that would benefit my company but I am deciding to twist my site to be a little more fitting. Hotel Ella is a historic and charming building located in the center of downtown Austin, Texas as an original landmark estate. The Greek revival mansion has a well-known upbringing and it's classic beauty continues to draw attention of tourists and locals as the perfect home away from home. In recent years, owners of the Hotel are talking about renovating the residence to incorporate a more modern and simplistic hospitality take while still holding onto the rich elegance of the historic home. My purpose for creating a site about the classy Hotel Ella is to have a space both signifying the importance of the hotel's history as well as emcompassing the new plans for the hotel and what this new renovation will bring to the community of Austin and all those near and far who have grown a love for our beloved Hotel Ella.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Those viewing my site will be corporate partners either from our own investing company or those of competing private equity companies. Investors will see this site as a projection on the building and what their partnership with our team could bring. Partners will show this site to teams within our company for growth and expectancy on how our changes will impact the company. And overall the site will bring insight and clarity into how we plan to change the Hotel to bring in more revenue. It will be an overall portfolio summary of the historic property and what our plan is with it. The audience is educated and most likely in their mid 30's to early 50's. With an estimated 60% of our audience being male, we are keeping this site both sophisticated and informational while keeping the colors and style that fit the Hotel. This site will most likely only be accessed by desktop/PC.   </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Why will people come to your site? </p>
        <p>People will come to this site to see the great and amazing Hotel Ella. The Hotel has been a huge part of Austin and its downtown historical portion of town since 1898. This hotel has a strong significance and impact on the community of Austin and brings many visitors to the area. The intricate details of its infrastructure and beautiful layout invite people from near and far to come and experience the Ella for themselves. It has character and charm and its area has something for everyone. </p>
        <p class= "accent1">What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</p>
        <p>This site will be a landing spot for people curious to learn more about Hotel Ella’s current state and what the hotel offers. This site is also inspiration and excitement for what is to come. With potential remodeling and restoration of the Hotel, there are many decisions to be made and how to go about continuously bringing the homey Hotel Ella the community loves while also bringing new life to the property and a modern inviting feel to new revival.

      <h3>Impacts of the Hotel</h3>
      <p class="accent1"> What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site? </p>
        <p>This site will be informational on what Hotel Ella is and what impact it has had on its community. It will invite new people to visit and experience the Hotel for themselves. The site will give the historic side of Hotel Ella as well as highlighting just a few of the major benefits of staying or visiting the elegant Hotel in downtown Austin. 
        The other part of this site will have the floor plan and all anticipated changes we plan to have while the Hotel will be under construction and how this will benefit the community. This part of the site is where we will draw in most of our traffic because it is what makes us different from other sites. The innovation and growth is what excites people and curiosity to see the greatest difference from what the Hotel once was. Only time will tell how evolved the Hotel will become.

      <p class="accent1">
        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? </p>
        <p>This site is like no other Hotel Ella informational site. This is not where you book your stay at Hotel Ella or see their breakfast menu. Hotel Ella brings many amazing things to this area. Not only is it a beautiful view and stay for those in the area; but its inviting pool side is just a few steps from the front entrance. The breakfast at the hotel is delectable and its coffee stand and bar give the excuse that any time of day is perfect for drinks. Within blocks of the Hotel is the Capital of Texas, Lady Bird Lake and a myriad of entertainment and history for all to enjoy. These are just some of the amazing things Hotel Ella has to offer but this site is not here to highlight those enlightening activities. This site is the change that we will be seeing with this beloved hotel. This site will tell you how important this hotel is as well as what will be changing to make it even better.</p>
       <p class="accent1"> What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? </p>
       <p>I am anticipating the floor plans for the Hotel this week as I speak with a few people on what our intentions are and firming up some more details and what we are wanting to bring to the community in this new change. There are some pretty big calls that are going to be made as we make final decisions that will determine the success and fruit of our labors. It is exciting as we transform something that was beautiful and historic to an inviting space that fulfills needs in the community and creates a peaceful and elegant space that fits in this modern time. Not only will I be speaking with people on the floor plans and confirming details, I will also be doing research to learn more about the Hotel’s history and Miss Ella herself and how the Hotel became what it is today. </p>

        This page is my personal favorite. It will go into our plans and intentions as we build Hotel Ella to be bigger and better. Combining both it's old history and a new mix of modern.
