 <h2>Isabella Kerr</h2>

 <p>Hey everybody! My name is Isabella. I'm currenly in my Junior year of school for my Bachelors in Business Finance and Entrepreneurship. I graduate next Fall which is exciting! I'm currently living near Seattle, Washington but will be moving to Austin, Texas in a few weeks for an internship opportunity.   </p> 
<p>I grew up remodeling and flipping houses while living in them with my family so I look forward towards using those skills and getting more into real estate again once I graduate.</p>
 <p>Outside of school and work, I love hiking, running, yoga and exploring. I love working with my hands and getting into new projects. While in Texas, I plan on building out my 4runner to better accommodate my weekend adventures.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking around to learn a little bit about me, I look forward to reading about everyone else as well! </p>
